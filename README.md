# Orinoco #

This project is a fictitious e-commerce site. Made in vanilla javascript, it allowed me to learn and improve myself in javascript, with also the use of localStorage, I took care of all the frontend part.

### Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Installation ###

Clone this repo. From within the project folder, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

### Frontend ###

You just have to clone the repo , then enter node server or nodemon if you have it , once the server is on the only thing you have to do is going to :
